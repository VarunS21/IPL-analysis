The dashboard also contains information on the individual performances of players and teams, as well as the overall performance of the league over the years.

The dashboard is also designed to be interactive, with users able to filter into the data to gain deeper insights.

One of the key features of the IPL dashboard is the use of complex DAX formulas to calculate metrics such as batting averages, bowling averages, run rate, boundaries, sixes and strike rates. These formulas are used to derive insights from the raw data, and are critical to the accuracy and reliability of the dashboard.
